# Tooltip UI

https://roadmap.sh/projects/tooltip-ui

In this project, you are required to create a tooltip that appears above navigation items when hovered, using only HTML and CSS. 

A tooltip is a small pop-up box that provides additional information about a navigation item when a user hovers over it. 

Bonus points for different animations for the tooltip, such as fade-in, slide-in, or scale-in effects.
